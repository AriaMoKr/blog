Files to Edit:
==============

_sections/intro.html 

This contains the bit at the top.
One-liner news, meetings and whatnot can go here, as
it will always show up when the site is loaded.

_posts

This is where the blogposts live. If you're creating a new 
blog post, put it here.

A new post has a particular requirement for naming. Each file should have the date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) and then the name of the post. So a blog entry for today (as I write this) would be `2018-04-11_blog_post_name.md.`

See also the tree list for more details of the files, where and what they are.

Markdown
========

Markdown is easy. If you're familiar with Reddit, it's the same principle!

— For italics, use *italicise* or _like this_
— For bold, **word**
— `code` is like this
— Lists can be unordered:

* list 
* elements
* like
	* this
	* and indented, too

…or ordered:

1 list
1 elements
1 like
	1 this
	1 and indented, too

— horizontal rules:
----
