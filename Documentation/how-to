Markdown
========

Markdown is easy. If you're familiar with Reddit, it's the same principle!

— For italics, use *italicise* or _like this_
— For bold, **word**
— `code` is like this
— Lists can be unordered:

* list 
* elements
* like
	* this
	* and indented, too

…or ordered:

1 list
1 elements
1 like
	1 this
	1 and indented, too

— horizontal rules:
----
