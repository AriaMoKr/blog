This is merely a test of the way this new site works. I've begun to write some simple documentation, and create a structure of the new site. We ***really*** need someone skilled with CSS, and also someone to design some simple graphics. Help please to sys@lugod.org.

I've also made a start on creating content, and figured out how images might work but it's a slow process.

So to begin. *italic*? **bold**? `code`?  
That is done with \*italic\*, \*\*bold\*\*, \`code\`

* hopefully
* this
* is 
* a list

Done with:  
\* hopefully  
\* thisâ€¦

1 Numbered
1 list
1 done with
	1 numbers
